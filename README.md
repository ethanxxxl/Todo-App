# Todo App

This is an API for a cross platform todo application, with compounding tasks,
becasue apparently it is too hard for any major todo app to do
recurring/compounding tasks correctly.

Currently, I am focusing on getting this working on Linux, potentially using DBus. later I will create a macos client, and then potentially iPadOS and Android clients as well.
